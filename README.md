# SP-DARTS: Soft Pruning Differentiable Architecture Search

## Description:
This project aims to solve the problems of Differentiable Architecture Search by introducing new search techniques based on soft pruning, namely SP/-DARTS and the progressive version SRPDARTS, as well as a criterion for determining the importance of operations to improve the accuracy and stability of the searched models.
